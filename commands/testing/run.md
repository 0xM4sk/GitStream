# Run test

I want to test $ARGUMENTS. 

### Remember...
- Use the test-runner agent to execute tests.
- Do not use mock services for anything ever.
- Do not move on to the next test until the current test is complete.
- If the test fails, consider checking if the test is structured correctly before deciding we need to refactor the codebase.
- Tests to be verbose so we can use them for debugging.

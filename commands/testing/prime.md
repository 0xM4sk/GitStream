# How to run tests

[ add your testing preference here ]


### IMPORTANT
- Use the test-runner agent to execute tests.
- Do not use mock services for anything ever.
- Do not move on to the next test until the current test is complete.
- If the test fails, consider checking if the test is structured correctly before deciding we need to refactor the codebase.
- Tests to be verbose so we can use them for debugging.

# Epic Decompose

Break epic into concrete, actionable tasks.

## Usage
```
/pm:epic-decompose <feature_name>
```

## Instructions

You are decomposing an epic into specific, actionable tasks for: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Read the Epic
- Load the epic from `.claude/issues/$ARGUMENTS/epic.md`
- Understand the technical approach and requirements
- Review the task breakdown preview

### 2. Task File Format with Frontmatter
For each task, create a file with this exact structure:

```markdown
---
name: [Task Title]
status: open
created: [Current ISO date/time]
updated: [Current ISO date/time]
github: [Will be updated when synced to GitHub]
---

# Task: [Task Title]

## Description
Clear, concise description of what needs to be done

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific criterion 1
- [ ] Specific criterion 2
- [ ] Specific criterion 3

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach
- Key considerations
- Code locations/files affected

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task/Issue dependencies
- [ ] External dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS/S/M/L/XL
- Hours: estimated hours
- Parallel: true/false (can run in parallel with other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
```

### 3. Task Naming Convention
Save tasks as: `.claude/issues/$ARGUMENTS/{task_number}.md`
- Use sequential numbering: 001.md, 002.md, etc.
- Keep task titles short but descriptive

### 4. Frontmatter Guidelines
- **name**: Use a descriptive task title (without "Task:" prefix)
- **status**: Always start with "open" for new tasks
- **created**: Use current date/time in ISO format
- **updated**: Same as created for new tasks
- **github**: Leave placeholder text - will be updated during sync

### 5. Task Types to Consider
- **Setup tasks**: Environment, dependencies, scaffolding
- **Data tasks**: Models, schemas, migrations
- **API tasks**: Endpoints, services, integration
- **UI tasks**: Components, pages, styling
- **Testing tasks**: Unit tests, integration tests
- **Documentation tasks**: README, API docs
- **Deployment tasks**: CI/CD, infrastructure

### 6. Parallelization
Mark tasks with `parallel: true` if they can be worked on simultaneously without conflicts.

### 7. Update Epic with Task Summary
After creating all tasks, update the epic file by adding this section:
```markdown
## Tasks Created
- [ ] 001.md - {Task Title} (parallel: true/false)
- [ ] 002.md - {Task Title} (parallel: true/false)
- etc.

Total tasks: {count}
Parallel tasks: {parallel_count}
Sequential tasks: {sequential_count}
```

Also update the epic's frontmatter progress if needed (still 0% until tasks actually start).

Aim for tasks that can be completed in 1-3 days each. Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces for the "$ARGUMENTS" epic.

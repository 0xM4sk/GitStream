# Task: AWS Cognito Infrastructure Setup

## Description

Set up the foundational AWS Cognito User Pool infrastructure with basic configuration, custom domain, SSL certificate, and initial Google OAuth provider integration as proof of concept. This includes all core AWS services and infrastructure as code deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cognito User Pool created with appropriate configuration
- [ ] Custom domain configured with SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager
- [ ] Google OAuth provider integrated and functional
- [ ] CloudFormation/CDK infrastructure as code template created
- [ ] Basic CloudWatch logging configured for authentication events
- [ ] Callback URLs properly configured for OAuth flow
- [ ] User Pool App Client configured with appropriate settings

## Technical Details

**Implementation approach:**
- Use CloudFormation or AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- Configure User Pool with email verification enabled
- Set up custom domain for branded login experience
- Implement SSL certificate through AWS Certificate Manager
- Configure OAuth callback URLs for development and production

**Key considerations:**
- User Pool configuration for federated identity providers
- Custom domain DNS configuration requirements
- SSL certificate validation and deployment
- CloudWatch logging setup for monitoring and debugging

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `/infrastructure/cognito-user-pool.yaml` or CDK equivalent
- `/config/oauth-providers.json` for provider configurations
- DNS configuration for custom domain

## Dependencies

- [ ] AWS account with appropriate permissions for Cognito, Certificate Manager, CloudWatch
- [ ] Domain control for DNS configuration
- [ ] Google OAuth application created (prerequisite)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: false (foundation task - other tasks depend on this)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Cognito User Pool fully configured and accessible
- [ ] Custom domain working with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Google OAuth login flow functional end-to-end
- [ ] Infrastructure deployed via CloudFormation/CDK
- [ ] Basic monitoring and logging operational
- [ ] Documentation updated with configuration details

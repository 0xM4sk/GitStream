# Task: Testing, Documentation & Production Deployment

## Description

Complete comprehensive end-to-end testing of the authentication system, create deployment documentation, implement monitoring and alerting, and deploy to production environment. Ensure system is production-ready with proper monitoring and documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] End-to-end testing completed for all authentication flows
- [ ] Integration testing with portal completed
- [ ] Performance testing validates response time requirements (<1s login, <3s OAuth)
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed with target users
- [ ] Deployment documentation and runbooks created
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured for authentication events
- [ ] Production deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested

## Technical Details

**Implementation approach:**
- Create comprehensive test suite covering all authentication scenarios
- Set up monitoring dashboards for authentication metrics
- Configure alerting for authentication failures and performance issues
- Deploy to production with proper backup and rollback procedures

**Key considerations:**
- Test coverage for all OAuth providers and edge cases
- Performance monitoring for authentication response times
- Error monitoring and alerting for production issues
- User onboarding documentation for administrators

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `/tests/e2e/authenticationFlows.test.js` - End-to-end test suite
- `/docs/deployment-guide.md` - Deployment documentation
- `/docs/admin-guide.md` - Administrative documentation
- CloudWatch dashboard configuration
- Production deployment scripts

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 7 completed (security configuration)
- [ ] Production AWS environment access
- [ ] Monitoring tools configured (CloudWatch, etc.)
- [ ] Target users available for acceptance testing

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: false (final integration and deployment task)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tests passing with >95% success rate
- [ ] Performance requirements met and validated
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] Documentation complete and accessible
- [ ] User onboarding process documented
- [ ] Support procedures documented
- [ ] Production system stable and monitored

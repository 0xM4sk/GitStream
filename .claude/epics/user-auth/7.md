# Task: Security Configuration & Testing

## Description

Implement comprehensive security measures including HTTPS enforcement, secure token storage, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and conduct thorough security testing of the entire authentication system. Ensure the system meets security best practices for production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] HTTPS-only communication enforced across all authentication flows
- [ ] Secure token storage implemented (httpOnly, secure flags)
- [ ] CSRF protection configured for all authentication forms
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented for login attempts
- [ ] Security headers configured (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Token validation security testing completed
- [ ] OAuth flow security testing for all providers
- [ ] Session management security validated
- [ ] Penetration testing or security audit completed

## Technical Details

**Implementation approach:**
- Configure web server for HTTPS-only communication
- Implement secure cookie configuration for tokens
- Add CSRF protection middleware for forms
- Set up rate limiting using AWS WAF or application-level controls
- Configure security headers for enhanced protection

**Key considerations:**
- Token storage security and XSS prevention
- CSRF attack prevention for authentication forms
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Security header configuration for browser protection
- OAuth flow security best practices

**Code locations/files affected:**
- Web server configuration (nginx/Apache)
- `/backend/middleware/securityMiddleware.js` - Security middleware
- `/src/utils/securityConfig.js` - Frontend security configuration
- AWS WAF configuration for rate limiting
- SSL/TLS certificate configuration

## Dependencies

- [ ] All previous tasks completed (2-5)
- [ ] Production-like environment for security testing
- [ ] SSL certificate configured and valid
- [ ] Access to security testing tools

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all components to be functional for comprehensive testing)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All security measures implemented and functional
- [ ] Security testing completed with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] HTTPS enforced across all authentication flows
- [ ] Token security validated against common attack vectors
- [ ] CSRF protection tested and functional
- [ ] Security documentation updated
- [ ] Production security checklist completed

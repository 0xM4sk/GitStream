# Task: Backend Portal Integration

## Description

Integrate authentication system with the existing RAG portal backend by implementing JWT token validation middleware, session management, user context injection, and protected route configuration. Ensure seamless authentication flow from login to portal access.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] JWT token validation middleware implemented for portal API endpoints
- [ ] User context injection for authenticated requests
- [ ] Protected route configuration for portal features
- [ ] Session management and token refresh handling on backend
- [ ] Integration with existing portal authentication checks
- [ ] User information accessible throughout portal application
- [ ] Logout endpoint properly clears all session data

## Technical Details

**Implementation approach:**
- Implement Express.js/Node.js middleware for JWT validation using Cognito public keys
- Create user context service for retrieving user information from tokens
- Configure protected routes to require valid authentication
- Integrate with existing portal backend architecture

**Key considerations:**
- JWT signature verification using Cognito public keys
- Token expiration and refresh handling
- User session state management
- Integration with existing portal middleware and authentication flow

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `/backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js` - JWT validation middleware
- `/backend/services/userService.js` - User context and session management
- `/backend/routes/protected.js` - Protected route configuration
- Existing portal route files for authentication integration

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2 completed (Cognito infrastructure for JWT validation)
- [ ] Task 6 completed (Frontend authentication for testing)
- [ ] Existing RAG portal backend codebase access
- [ ] Understanding of current portal authentication architecture

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (requires frontend authentication to be functional for testing)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All portal API endpoints properly protected with authentication
- [ ] JWT tokens validated correctly against Cognito
- [ ] User information accessible throughout portal backend
- [ ] Session expiration handled gracefully
- [ ] Logout clears all backend session state
- [ ] Integration testing with frontend authentication completed
- [ ] Existing portal functionality works with new authentication

# Task: Frontend Authentication UI

## Description

Develop the frontend authentication interface using Cognito SDK, including login page with provider selection, user profile display, logout functionality, and seamless integration with the portal. Focus on simple, clean UI that works with Cognito hosted UI or custom implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Login page with OAuth provider selection (Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Email/Password)
- [ ] Cognito SDK integrated for token handling and authentication flows
- [ ] User profile component displaying name, email, and authentication provider
- [ ] Logout functionality with proper token invalidation
- [ ] Automatic redirection to portal dashboard after successful authentication
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback for authentication failures
- [ ] Responsive design working on desktop and mobile browsers

## Technical Details

**Implementation approach:**
- Use AWS Cognito SDK for JavaScript/React integration
- Leverage Cognito hosted UI for OAuth flows to minimize custom code
- Implement token storage and refresh handling
- Create clean, simple UI components for authentication

**Key considerations:**
- Token security and storage (httpOnly cookies preferred)
- Session management and automatic refresh
- Error handling for various authentication failure scenarios
- User experience flow from login to portal access

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `/src/components/AuthLogin.js` - Login interface component
- `/src/components/UserProfile.js` - User profile display
- `/src/services/authService.js` - Authentication service layer
- `/src/utils/cognitoConfig.js` - Cognito SDK configuration

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2 completed (Cognito infrastructure)
- [ ] Existing portal frontend codebase access
- [ ] Node.js/React development environment

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside OAuth provider configuration)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete authentication UI functional with all providers
- [ ] User session persists correctly across browser sessions
- [ ] Token refresh works automatically without user intervention
- [ ] Logout clears all authentication state properly
- [ ] Integration with existing portal seamless
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] Code reviewed and tested across different browsers

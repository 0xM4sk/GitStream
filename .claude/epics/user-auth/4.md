# Task: OAuth Provider Configuration

## Description

Configure Microsoft and LinkedIn OAuth providers in addition to Google, including application registration in respective developer consoles, Cognito federated identity provider setup, and testing of all OAuth flows. Ensure all three providers work seamlessly with the authentication system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Microsoft Azure AD application created and configured
- [ ] LinkedIn Developer Portal application created and configured
- [ ] Microsoft OAuth provider integrated with Cognito User Pool
- [ ] LinkedIn OAuth provider integrated with Cognito User Pool
- [ ] All OAuth callback URLs properly configured for each provider
- [ ] OAuth scopes configured to retrieve email and basic profile information
- [ ] All three providers (Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn) tested and functional

## Technical Details

**Implementation approach:**
- Register applications in Microsoft Azure AD and LinkedIn Developer Portal
- Configure federated identity providers in Cognito User Pool
- Set up appropriate OAuth scopes for profile information
- Test each provider's OAuth flow independently

**Key considerations:**
- Different OAuth scope requirements across providers
- Callback URL consistency across all providers
- Provider-specific configuration requirements
- Error handling for OAuth flow failures

**Code locations/files affected:**
- Cognito User Pool federated identity provider configuration
- `/config/oauth-providers.json` for provider-specific settings
- OAuth application configurations in external developer consoles

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2 completed (Cognito User Pool infrastructure)
- [ ] Microsoft Azure AD developer account access
- [ ] LinkedIn Developer Portal account access
- [ ] Domain and callback URL configuration from Task 2

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside frontend tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Microsoft OAuth login functional end-to-end
- [ ] LinkedIn OAuth login functional end-to-end
- [ ] All OAuth providers return consistent user profile information
- [ ] Error handling implemented for failed OAuth flows
- [ ] Provider selection working correctly in Cognito hosted UI
- [ ] Documentation updated with provider configuration details

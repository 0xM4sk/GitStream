# Issue #2 Progress: AWS Cognito Infrastructure Setup

## Overview
Setting up foundational AWS Cognito User Pool infrastructure with basic configuration, custom domain, SSL certificate, and initial Google OAuth provider integration as proof of concept.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Read and analyzed requirements from task and epic files
- [x] Created progress tracking structure
- [x] Initialized todo list for task breakdown

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Designed comprehensive AWS Cognito User Pool configuration
- [x] Created complete CloudFormation infrastructure template
- [x] Implemented custom domain and SSL certificate setup
- [x] Configured Google OAuth provider integration
- [x] Implemented comprehensive CloudWatch logging and monitoring
- [x] Created detailed deployment and setup documentation
- [x] Built automated deployment and cleanup scripts

## Files Created
- `/infrastructure/cognito-user-pool.yaml` - Complete CloudFormation template
- `/infrastructure/cloudwatch-logging.yaml` - Monitoring infrastructure
- `/config/oauth-providers.json` - OAuth provider configurations
- `/docs/cognito-design.md` - Infrastructure design specification
- `/docs/ssl-domain-setup.md` - SSL certificate and domain setup guide
- `/docs/deployment-guide.md` - Complete deployment documentation
- `/scripts/deploy-cognito-infrastructure.sh` - Automated deployment script
- `/scripts/cleanup-cognito-infrastructure.sh` - Infrastructure cleanup script
- `/README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation

## Dependencies Status
- AWS account access: ‚úÖ (assumed available)
- Domain control: ‚ö†Ô∏è (will document requirements)
- Google OAuth app: üìã (will create configuration template)

## Notes
- This is the foundation task - all other authentication tasks depend on this infrastructure
- Using CloudFormation for infrastructure as code approach
- Starting with Google OAuth as proof of concept before adding other providers
- Following coordination rules to avoid conflicts with parallel tasks

## Next Steps
1. Design comprehensive Cognito User Pool configuration
2. Create CloudFormation template with all required resources
3. Document custom domain setup requirements
4. Create Google OAuth provider configuration template

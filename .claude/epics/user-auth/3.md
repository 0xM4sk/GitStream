# Task: Email/Password Authentication System

## Description

Implement email/password authentication as a fallback option using Cognito User Pool's built-in capabilities, including user registration, email verification, password reset functionality, and basic password policy configuration. Ensure seamless integration with OAuth providers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Email/password user registration functional through Cognito
- [ ] Email verification process working with AWS SES
- [ ] Password reset via email implemented
- [ ] Basic password policy configured (length, complexity)
- [ ] Login form for email/password authentication
- [ ] Account recovery mechanisms functional
- [ ] Integration with existing OAuth flows seamless
- [ ] User registration prevents duplicate accounts across providers

## Technical Details

**Implementation approach:**
- Configure Cognito User Pool for email/password authentication
- Set up AWS SES for email delivery (verification, password reset)
- Implement password policy and complexity requirements
- Create registration and login forms integrated with Cognito SDK

**Key considerations:**
- Email deliverability and SES configuration
- Password security and hashing (handled by Cognito)
- User experience for email verification flow
- Prevention of duplicate accounts with same email across different auth methods

**Code locations/files affected:**
- Cognito User Pool password policy configuration
- AWS SES email template configuration
- `/src/components/EmailPasswordLogin.js` - Email/password login form
- `/src/components/PasswordReset.js` - Password reset functionality
- `/src/services/authService.js` - Extended with email/password methods

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2 completed (Cognito infrastructure)
- [ ] AWS SES configured for email delivery
- [ ] Domain verification for SES email sending

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside other authentication components)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User registration with email/password working end-to-end
- [ ] Email verification emails delivered and functional
- [ ] Password reset flow working correctly
- [ ] Login with email/password functional
- [ ] Password policy enforced during registration
- [ ] Account recovery mechanisms tested
- [ ] Integration with OAuth login options seamless

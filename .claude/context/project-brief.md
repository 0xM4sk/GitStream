# Project Brief

## What It Does

**Claude Code PM (CCPM)** is a comprehensive project management system specifically designed for AI-assisted software development using Claude Code. It transforms the development process from ad-hoc "vibe coding" to structured, spec-driven development with complete traceability from requirements to production code.

### Core Capabilities

**Structured Workflow Management**
- Guides teams through a disciplined 5-phase development process
- Converts ideas into detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Transforms PRDs into technical implementation epics
- Decomposes epics into actionable, parallelizable tasks

**Parallel AI Execution**
- Enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of the same feature
- Uses Git worktrees to provide conflict-free parallel development environments
- Coordinates agent activities through file-based communication and Git operations
- Scales from single developer to multi-team environments

**Context Optimization**
- Maintains clean conversation context by delegating implementation details to specialized agents
- Preserves project context across development sessions
- Provides structured context management for complex projects
- Optimizes AI performance through strategic context partitioning

## Why It Exists

### Problems Solved

**Context Evaporation**
Traditional AI-assisted development suffers from context loss between sessions, forcing developers to constantly re-explain project details and rediscover previous decisions.

**Serial Development Bottlenecks**
Most development happens sequentially, limiting the potential velocity gains from AI assistance and creating dependencies that slow overall progress.

**Requirements Drift**
Without structured specifications, AI-assisted development can drift from original intentions, leading to features that don't meet actual requirements.

**Invisible Progress**
Development progress becomes difficult to track and communicate, especially when working with AI agents that don't naturally integrate with team workflows.

**Team Collaboration Friction**
AI-assisted development often happens in isolation, making it difficult for teams to collaborate effectively and maintain awareness of progress.

### Strategic Response

CCPM addresses these challenges by providing:
- **Persistent Context**: Project state maintained across sessions and team members
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working simultaneously on related tasks
- **Specification Discipline**: Every line of code traced back to documented requirements
- **Team Integration**: Native GitHub integration for transparent collaboration
- **Scalable Coordination**: From individual developers to enterprise teams

## Project Scope

### In Scope

**Core Project Management Workflow**
- PRD creation through guided brainstorming
- Epic planning with technical implementation details
- Task decomposition with parallelization analysis
- GitHub synchronization and issue management
- Progress tracking and status reporting

**Agent Coordination System**
- Specialized agents for different task types (code analysis, testing, file analysis)
- Parallel execution in Git worktrees
- Conflict detection and resolution workflows
- Progress communication and aggregation

**Development Support Tools**
- Context management and optimization
- Testing framework integration
- Code analysis and bug research capabilities
- Documentation generation and maintenance

### Out of Scope

**Direct Code Generation**
- System focuses on workflow and coordination, not code generation itself
- Relies on Claude Code's existing capabilities for actual development tasks

**Alternative Version Control Systems**
- Git and GitHub integration only
- No support for other VCS or issue tracking systems

**Enterprise Project Management Integration**
- No direct integration with Jira, Asana, or other enterprise PM tools
- GitHub Issues serve as the single source of truth

## Key Objectives

### Primary Goals

**Eliminate Context Loss**
- Achieve 90%+ context retention across development sessions
- Enable seamless handoffs between team members and AI agents
- Maintain complete project history and decision rationale

**Maximize Development Velocity**
- Enable 3-5x faster feature delivery through parallel execution
- Reduce context switching overhead by 85%+
- Scale AI-assisted development across teams

**Ensure Quality and Traceability**
- Reduce bug rates by 75% through structured task breakdown
- Maintain complete audit trail from requirements to code
- Enable systematic testing and validation approaches

### Secondary Goals

**Improve Team Collaboration**
- Provide real-time visibility into AI-assisted development progress
- Enable effective human-AI collaboration patterns
- Support mixed team composition (humans + AI agents)

**Optimize AI Performance**
- Maximize AI effectiveness through context optimization
- Enable specialized AI agents for different task types
- Reduce AI context window pressure through strategic partitioning

## Success Criteria

### Delivery Success
- Complete workflow from PRD creation to production deployment
- Parallel execution of 5-8 tasks simultaneously without conflicts
- Successful GitHub integration with issue tracking and progress updates

### Adoption Success
- Teams report significant improvement in development velocity
- Reduced time to onboard new team members to AI-assisted workflows
- Positive feedback on development experience and productivity

### Quality Success
- Demonstrable reduction in bug rates and rework
- Improved code quality through systematic development approach
- Enhanced project documentation and knowledge transfer

## Strategic Priorities

1. **Context Preservation** - Never lose project knowledge or decisions
2. **Parallel Execution** - Maximize velocity through coordinated AI agents
3. **Team Integration** - Work with existing tools and workflows
4. **Quality Assurance** - Maintain high standards through systematic approach
5. **Scalability** - Support growth from individual to enterprise usage

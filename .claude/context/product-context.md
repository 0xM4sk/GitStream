# Product Context

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**Development Teams Using Claude Code**
- Individual developers working with AI assistance
- Small to medium development teams (2-10 developers)
- Teams struggling with context loss and coordination issues
- Organizations adopting AI-assisted development workflows

**Technical Characteristics:**
- Comfortable with command-line tools
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Familiar with markdown and documentation practices
- Working on software projects of various sizes

### Secondary Users

**Project Managers and Team Leads**
- Need visibility into AI-assisted development progress
- Require structured workflows and audit trails
- Want to scale AI development across teams
- Seeking integration with existing project management tools

**Enterprise Development Organizations**
- Large teams with complex coordination requirements
- Need standardized development workflows
- Require compliance and audit capabilities
- Want to maximize AI development productivity

## Core Functionality

### 1. Structured Development Workflow
**Problem Solved:** Context loss and "vibe coding" without specifications
**Solution:** 5-phase discipline from PRD to production code
- Guided brainstorming for comprehensive requirements
- Technical planning with architectural decisions
- Task decomposition with clear acceptance criteria
- Parallel execution with specialized agents
- Complete traceability and audit trail

### 2. Parallel Development Execution
**Problem Solved:** Serial task execution limiting development velocity
**Solution:** Multi-agent parallel execution system
- Git worktrees for conflict-free parallel work
- Specialized agents for different types of tasks
- Intelligent coordination through file-based communication
- Automatic progress aggregation and tracking

### 3. Context Preservation and Optimization
**Problem Solved:** Context window limitations and information loss
**Solution:** Structured context management system
- Persistent context across development sessions
- Context partitioning across specialized agents
- Automatic context cleanup and optimization
- Strategic vs. implementation detail separation

### 4. GitHub Integration and Collaboration
**Problem Solved:** AI development happening in isolation from team workflows
**Solution:** Native GitHub integration for team collaboration
- Issues as single source of truth for project state
- Real-time progress visibility for team members
- Seamless human-AI handoffs through issue comments
- Integration with existing GitHub workflows and tools

## Use Cases

### Individual Developer Scenarios

**Feature Development**
1. Create PRD for new feature using guided brainstorming
2. Generate technical implementation plan

4. Execute with multiple specialized agents simultaneously
5. Track progress and merge completed work

**Bug Investigation and Resolution**
1. Use code-analyzer agent to investigate reported issues
2. Create structured analysis and reproduction steps
3. Develop fix with appropriate test coverage
4. Document resolution and prevention measures

**Code Review and Refactoring**
1. Analyze existing codebase for improvement opportunities
2. Create structured refactoring plan with risk assessment
3. Execute refactoring in parallel streams
4. Validate changes with comprehensive testing

### Team Development Scenarios

**Sprint Planning and Execution**
1. Convert user stories to detailed PRDs
2. Generate technical epics with task breakdown
3. Distribute tasks across team members and AI agents
4. Track progress through GitHub issues
5. Coordinate completion and integration

**Cross-Team Collaboration**
1. Share epic progress across multiple teams
2. Coordinate dependent tasks and deliverables

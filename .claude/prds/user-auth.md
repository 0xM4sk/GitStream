# PRD: user-auth

## Executive Summary

Build a streamlined OAuth authentication system for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge portal hosted on AWS. The system will enable vendors and business users to securely access shared artifacts and insights through LLM inference pipelines. Primary focus is on Microsoft, Google, and LinkedIn OAuth integration with email/password fallback, supporting a small user base (<10 users) with simple viewer-level access control.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Currently, there is no authentication mechanism for the RAG knowledge portal, preventing secure access to shared business artifacts and LLM-generated insights. Without proper authentication, vendors and business stakeholders cannot safely access or contribute to the knowledge sharing ecosystem.

**Why is this important now?**
- Business needs to share sensitive artifacts with vendors securely
- LLM inference pipeline requires controlled access to prevent unauthorized usage
- Small user base requires simple, efficient authentication without complexity overhead
- OAuth integration reduces password management burden for users
- Foundation needed before portal can be used for business-critical knowledge sharing

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Business User (Internal)**
- **Role**: Internal team member accessing shared knowledge base
- **Goals**: Quick access to insights, ability to upload/share artifacts securely
- **Pain Points**: Wants seamless login without managing another password
- **Preferred Flow**: OAuth with corporate Microsoft/Google account

**Vendor User (External)**
- **Role**: External vendor needing access to specific shared artifacts
- **Goals**: Access relevant documents and insights for collaboration
- **Pain Points**: Needs simple access method, may not have corporate OAuth accounts
- **Preferred Flow**: LinkedIn OAuth or email/password for flexibility

### Detailed User Journeys

**First-Time User Registration**
1. User visits RAG portal URL
2. Presented with login options: Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, Email/Password
3. Selects preferred OAuth provider or creates email/password account
4. Completes OAuth flow or registration
5. Redirected to portal dashboard with viewer access
6. Can immediately access shared artifacts and LLM insights

**Returning User Login**
1. User visits portal
2. Recognizes previous OAuth provider or enters email/password
3. Single-click OAuth or credential entry
4. Immediate access to portal with preserved session state

**Session Management**
1. User remains logged in for reasonable duration (7 days)
2. Session refresh handled transparently
3. Secure logout clears all session data

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Authentication Features**
- OAuth integration with Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn providers
- Email/password registration and login as fallback option
- User session management with configurable duration
- Secure logout functionality
- Simple user profile display (name, email, provider)

**User Access Control**
- All authenticated users have viewer-level access (no role differentiation needed)
- Session-based access to RAG portal features
- Ability to revoke user access (admin function)

**OAuth Integration**
- Microsoft OAuth 2.0 integration
- Google OAuth 2.0 integration  
- LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 integration
- Secure token storage and refresh handling
- Provider-agnostic user identification

**Email/Password System**
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt or equivalent)
- Password reset via email
- Email verification for new accounts
- Account recovery mechanisms

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Expectations**
- OAuth flow completion in <3 seconds
- Login response time <1 second
- Session validation <500ms
- Supports concurrent users (up to 10)

**Security Considerations**
- OAuth tokens encrypted at rest
- HTTPS-only communication
- CSRF protection for all forms
- Secure session cookies with httpOnly, secure flags
- Password complexity requirements (if using email/password)
- Rate limiting on login attempts

**Scalability Needs**
- Designed for <10 concurrent users initially
- Architecture supports scaling to 100+ users if needed
- Stateless session management compatible with AWS scaling

**AWS Integration**
- Compatible with AWS Lambda/ECS deployment
- Uses AWS Cognito User Pools or custom DynamoDB user storage
- Integrates with existing AWS infrastructure
- CloudWatch logging for authentication events

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

**Functional Success**
- 100% of target users (vendors + business) can successfully authenticate
- OAuth success rate >95% for supported providers
- Zero security incidents related to authentication
- User session stability >99% uptime

**User Experience Success**
- Average login time <10 seconds (including OAuth redirects)
- User satisfaction >4.5/5 for authentication experience
- <1 support ticket per month related to login issues
- Zero user-reported security concerns

**Technical Success**
- API response time <1 second for authentication endpoints
- Compatible with existing AWS RAG infrastructure
- Monitoring and logging provide clear audit trail
- Easy deployment with minimal configuration (OAuth keys only)

### Key Metrics and KPIs

- **Authentication Success Rate**: >95%
- **Session Duration**: Average 2-4 hours active usage
- **Provider Distribution**: Track which OAuth providers are preferred
- **Support Burden**: <1 hour/month spent on auth-related issues
- **Security Events**: Zero unauthorized access attempts succeeding

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must integrate with existing AWS backend infrastructure
- OAuth provider APIs must be accessible from AWS environment
- Email service required for password reset functionality
- Small user base doesn't justify complex identity management solutions

### Timeline Constraints
- Implementation should be straightforward with existing OAuth libraries
- Priority on working system over advanced features
- Quick deployment desired to unblock portal usage

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer implementation
- Minimal ongoing maintenance requirements
- Cost-effective solution (leverage free OAuth provider tiers)
- Simple configuration (OAuth API keys from admin)

### Key Assumptions
- Users have access to Microsoft, Google, or LinkedIn accounts
- Small user base won't require advanced user management
- All users need same level of access (viewers only)
- AWS infrastructure can handle OAuth callback URLs
- Users accept third-party OAuth for convenience

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Building
- **Role-based access control**: All users get viewer access
- **Multi-factor authentication**: OAuth provides sufficient security
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Not needed for small user base
- **API key authentication**: Human users only, no programmatic access
- **Advanced user management**: No user provisioning, complex permissions
- **Custom identity provider**: Standard OAuth only
- **Mobile app authentication**: Web application only
- **User registration approval workflow**: Self-service registration
- **Audit logs for user actions**: Authentication events only
- **Password complexity policies**: Basic requirements only

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **OAuth Provider APIs**:
  - Microsoft Graph API access
  - Google OAuth 2.0 API access
  - LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 API access
- **Email Service**: AWS SES or similar for password reset emails
- **SSL Certificate**: HTTPS required for OAuth callbacks

### Internal Dependencies
- **AWS Infrastructure**: Existing RAG portal backend
- **Domain/URL**: Stable URL for OAuth callback configuration
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure storage for OAuth client secrets

### Admin Requirements
- **OAuth Application Setup**: 
  - Create apps in Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn developer consoles
  - Configure callback URLs
  - Obtain client IDs and secrets
- **DNS Configuration**: Ensure callback URLs are accessible

### Third-Party Services
- **OAuth Providers**: Microsoft Azure AD, Google Cloud Console, LinkedIn Developer Portal
- **Email Delivery**: AWS SES or equivalent email service
- **Session Storage**: AWS DynamoDB or similar for session management

## Implementation Notes

### Recommended Architecture
- **Frontend**: OAuth redirect flows with simple login UI
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda functions for authentication endpoints
- **Storage**: DynamoDB for user profiles and session management
- **Security**: AWS Cognito User Pools or custom JWT token management

### OAuth Configuration Requirements
- Callback URLs: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback/{provider}`
- Scopes: Basic profile information (email, name)
- Client configuration: Web application type for all providers

### Development Approach
- Start with one OAuth provider (Google) as proof of concept
- Add email/password as reliable fallback
- Integrate additional OAuth providers iteratively
- Focus on secure session management from day one
